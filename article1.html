      When I’m overwhelmed in a crowd, I distract myself by looking for as many red-colored objects as I can. Red is not typically a calming color, especially if you’re staring at miles of brake lights in traffic, but it’s really easy for me to see. Red becomes the most dominant thing on my mind.

      Humans have used red since the neolithic era, as seen in the prehistoric cave drawings; When developing languages, red is typically the color named first after black and white. It’s now used so frequently in advertising—because it attracts the most attention—that people have learned to ignore it. <span class="highlight-red">( The ad industry has successfully made a highly visible color...invisible. )</span>

		In grade school, I learned that yellow was the most soothing to color with when I brought the expensive markers 
		I wasn’t allowed to use at home to school. I colored in a picture of Paddington wearing a raincoat well enough 
		for my teacher to hang it on the wall for parent-teacher day.

		Colors can be hard to see. To the chemist John Dalton, red, orange, yellow, and green all appeared the same. The rest of the color spectrum appeared as gradients of blue and purple. Dalton went on to write the first scientific paper on the subject of color blindness,<span class="highlight-green"> ( 'Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours' in 1798. )</span>

		The artist Wassily Kandinsky could practically hear and taste color because of his synesthesia. To him yellow was a trumpet’s C note, black was the end of things, <span class="highlight-blue">( 'blue is cold, red is a square, and green is a feeling,' )</span> as summarized by the painter Amy Sillman who called Kandinsky’s philosophy a kind of color astrology in her essay 'Drug, Poison, Remedy, Talisman, Cosmetic, Intoxicant.'

		In 1810, writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe decided that an equilateral triangle was the most effective form for his ideas on the psychological effect of colors. This new way of organizing color came about a hundred years after Sir Isaac Newton first arranged colors on a disk, to create an early form of the color wheel.

		We can see those softened outlines because light helps us discern forms. I find Vantablack—one of the darkest known substances, absorbing 99.96% of visible light—unsettling. As Kassia St Clair explains in The Secret Lives of Color, 'black is an expression of light, in this case, it’s absence.' My eyes hunt for the surface, and Vantablack leaves nothing to see.
