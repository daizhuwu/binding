			<h1>Everyday Color Theory</h1>
			<p class="subtitle">A poetic crash course on the history of color</p>
			<p class="details">A version of this essay was presented at SPAN 2019 during the “Hue & Glue: Hands-On Color Theory” workshop. Read to the end to find instructions for an exercise that explores the relationship between color and light</p>

			<h2>RED</h2>
			<blockquote>
				“If one says ‘red’ and there are fifty people listening, it can be expected that there will be fifty reds in their minds.” — Josef Albers
			</blockquote>
			<p>When I’m overwhelmed in a crowd I distract myself by looking for as many red-colored objects as I can. Red is not typically a calming color, especially if you’re staring at miles of brake lights in traffic, but it’s really easy for me to see. Red becomes the most dominant thing on my mind.</p>
			<p>Humans have used red since the neolithic era, as seen in the prehistoric cave drawings; When developing languages, red is typically the color named first after black and white. It’s now used so frequently in advertising—because it attracts the most attention—that people have learned to ignore it. The ad industry has successfully made a highly visible color…invisible.</p>

			<h2>YELLOW</h2>
			<blockquote>
				“Yellow tries to show you the way.” — Laurie Schwartz
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				In grade school, I learned that yellow was the most soothing to color with when I brought the expensive markers I wasn’t allowed to use at home to school. I colored in a picture of Paddington wearing a raincoat well enough for my teacher to hang it on the wall for parent-teacher day. The comfort I experienced from quietly meeting the black lines with a high-contrast yellow, disappeared as I waited for my mother to find me out.
			</p>
			<p>
				In her piece commemorating a decade of internet colors, designer Laurel Schwulst reflects that 'yellow tries to show you the way' in Google Maps. Artist Ian Whittlesea describes yellow as the easiest to mentally conjure in his seven breathing exercises to become invisible—inspired by the literature of Rosicrucianism, theosophy, and esoteric yoga.

			<h2>GREEN</h2>
			<blockquote>
				“Green can be the most difficult to keep stable.” — Ian Whittlesea
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				According to Whittlesea, Indigo is the most difficult color to generate and green can be the most difficult to keep stable.
			</p>
			<p>
				Colors can be hard to see. To the chemist John Dalton, red, orange, yellow, and green all appeared the same. The rest of the color spectrum appeared as gradients of blue and purple. Dalton went on to write the first scientific paper on the subject of color blindness, 'Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours' in 1798.

			<h2>BLUE</h2>
			<blockquote>
				“Blue is cold, red is a square, and green is a feeling.” — Wassily Kandinsky
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The artist Wassily Kandinsky could practically hear and taste color because of his synesthesia. To him yellow was a trumpet’s C note, black was the end of things, 'blue is cold, red is a square, and green is a feeling,' as summarized by the painter Amy Sillman who called Kandinsky’s philosophy a kind of color astrology in her essay 'Drug, Poison, Remedy, Talisman, Cosmetic, Intoxicant.'
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1810, writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe decided that an equilateral triangle was the most effective form for his ideas on the psychological effect of colors. This new way of organizing color came about a hundred years after Sir Isaac Newton first arranged colors on a disk, to create an early form of the color wheel.

			<h2>WHITE</h2>
			<blockquote>
				“Very few people have seen pure white.” — Ludwig Wittgenstein
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				White surfaces reflect and scatter visible light, and according to Wittgenstein 'very few people have seen pure white.' In the essay 'In Praise of Shadows' on traditional Japanese aesthetics, Jun’ichirō Tanizaki wrote that 'western paper turns away light, while [Japanese] paper seems to take it in, to envelope it gently, like the soft surface of a first snowfall.'
			</p>
			<p>
				If you take a piece of computer paper, that you know is white in its normal surroundings, and place it next to snow, the paper may appear grey. A white can be light grey in poor lighting or a light grey in good lighting.

			<h2>BLACK</h2>
			<blockquote>
				“Black is an expression of light; in this case, it is absence.” — Kassia St Clair
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				We can see those softened outlines because light helps us discern forms. I find Vantablack—one of the darkest known substances, absorbing 99.96% of visible light—unsettling. As Kassia St Clair explains in The Secret Lives of Color, 'black is an expression of light, in this case, it’s absence.' My eyes hunt for the surface, and Vantablack leaves nothing to see.
